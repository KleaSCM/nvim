# 🖥️ Terminal Setup Guide

## 🎉 What We Fixed

We've successfully restored the **actual working Wezterm terminals** that you had before! No more overcomplicated "Cursor CLI" nonsense - just beautiful, functional terminals exactly where you need them.

## ✨ What You Now Have

### **Right Terminal**
- **Keybinding**: `<leader>cc`
- **Function**: Creates a terminal on the right side
- **Usage**: Perfect for running commands while coding

### **Bottom Terminal**
- **Keybinding**: `<leader>tb`
- **Function**: Creates a terminal at the bottom
- **Usage**: Great for build output, logs, or additional commands

### **Perfect Layout**
- **Keybinding**: `<leader>wl`
- **Function**: Sets up the perfect three-panel layout
- **Result**: File explorer (left), Editor (center), Terminal (right), Terminal (bottom)

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Real Terminal Integration**
- Uses Neovim's built-in `:terminal` command
- Perfect Wezterm integration

### **Terminal Navigation**
- **`<C-h>`** - Navigate left from terminal
- **`<C-j>`** - Navigate down from terminal
- **`<C-k>`** - Navigate up from terminal
