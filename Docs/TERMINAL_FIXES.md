# Terminal Fixes and Autocmd Safety

## Overview
This document describes the fixes applied to resolve terminal-related issues, autocmd safety problems, and LSP configuration issues in the Neovim configuration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lualine Notices Buffer Error
**Problem**: The `BufHidden` autocmd was attempting to delete the Lualine Notices buffer while it was still in use, causing the error:
```
Error executing lua callback: Vim(bdelete):E937: Attempt to delete a buffer that is in use: Lualine Notices
```

**Solution**: Enhanced the `BufHidden` autocmd with intelligent buffer filtering:
- Added protection for important system buffers (Lualine, Telescope, Neo-tree, etc.)
- Implemented safe buffer deletion using `pcall` and `nvim_buf_delete`
- Fallback to hiding buffers instead of deletion if deletion fails
- Added buffer validation checks before attempting operations

### 2. Terminal Buffer Safety
**Problem**: Terminal buffers could cause errors during cleanup operations.

**Solution**: Enhanced terminal autocmds with safety measures:
- Safe terminal closing using `pcall` and proper error handling
- Fallback to hiding terminal buffers if deletion fails
- Buffer validation before operations

### 3. LSP Server Deprecation Warnings
**Problem**: Using deprecated `tsserver` server name which will be removed in lspconfig 0.2.1.

**Solution**: Updated to modern server names:
- Changed `tsserver` → `ts_ls` (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Added additional modern LSP servers (HTML, CSS, Emmet)
- Ensured all server names are current and supported

## Technical Details

### Protected Buffer Types
The following buffer types are now protected from automatic deletion:
- `Lualine*` - Status line notices and components
- `Telescope*` - Search results and pickers
- `Neo-tree*` - File explorer
- `Trouble*` - Diagnostic display
- `Mason*` - Package manager
- `Lazy*` - Plugin manager

### LSP Server Configuration
**Modern Server Names**:
- `ts_ls` - TypeScript/JavaScript (replaces deprecated `tsserver`)
- `lua_ls` - Lua language support
- `pyright` - Python language support
- `gopls` - Go language support
- `rust_analyzer` - Rust language support
- `clangd` - C/C++ language support
- `html` - HTML language support
- `cssls` - CSS language support
- `emmet_ls` - Emmet abbreviation support

### Safety Mechanisms
1. **Buffer Name Filtering**: Checks buffer names against protected patterns
2. **Buffer Validation**: Verifies buffer exists and is valid before operations
3. **Safe Deletion**: Uses `pcall` to handle deletion errors gracefully
4. **Fallback Handling**: Hides buffers instead of forcing deletion

### Code Example
```lua
-- Safe buffer cleanup with protection
api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufHidden", {
	group = group,
	pattern = "*",
	callback = function()
		local buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
		local buf_name = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buf)
		
		-- Skip important system buffers
		if buf_name:match("^Lualine") or 
		   buf_name:match("^Telescope") then
			return
		end
		
		-- Safe deletion with fallback
		if vim.bo.buftype == "nofile" and not vim.bo.buflisted then
			local ok, _ = pcall(vim.api.nvim_buf_delete, buf, { force = false })
			if not ok then
				vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(buf, "bufhidden", "hide")
			end
		end
	end,
})
```

## Testing
Run the autocmd safety tests to verify the fixes:
```lua
:lua require("Tests.autocmd_safety_test").run_all_tests()
```

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use `pcall` for potentially dangerous operations
2. Validate buffers before operations
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
4. Test autocmds with various buffer types
5. Document protected buffer patterns
6. Use current, non-deprecated LSP server names
7. Regularly update LSP configurations

✅ **RESOLVED** - LSP server deprecation warnings eliminated
✅ **TESTED** - Safety mechanisms verified with test suite
✅ **DOCUMENTED** - Complete documentation of fixes and prevention measures
✅ **MODERNIZED** - Updated to current LSP server standards
